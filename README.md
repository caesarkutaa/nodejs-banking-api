## Introduction

The Bank API is designed to facilitate banking operations such as account management, transaction processing, balance inquiries, and more. It provides a RESTful interface to interact with the bank's systems securely and efficiently.

## Installation

To install and run the Bank API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd bank-api`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Configure the API by setting the necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection details, security settings).
5. Start the API server: `npm start`

Note: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine before running the above commands.

## Usage

Once the Bank API is installed and running, you can interact with it by sending HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoints. The API supports various operations, including creating accounts, making transactions, retrieving account information, and more.

To use the API effectively, refer to the documentation below for available endpoints and their usage.

## Endpoints

The following are the main endpoints provided by the Bank API:

- `GET /accounts`: Retrieves a list of all accounts.
- `GET /accounts/:id`: Retrieves detailed information about a specific account.
- `POST /accounts`: Creates a new account.
- `PUT /accounts/:id`: Updates account details.
- `DELETE /accounts/:id`: Deletes an account.

- `GET /transactions`: Retrieves a list of all transactions.
- `GET /transactions/:id`: Retrieves detailed information about a specific transaction.
- `POST /transactions`: Creates a new transaction.
- `PUT /transactions/:id`: Updates transaction details.
- `DELETE /transactions/:id`: Deletes a transaction.

Refer to the API documentation or consult with the API provider for more detailed information on each endpoint, including request/response formats and any additional parameters.

## Authentication

The Bank API implements authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access to the endpoints. To authenticate requests, include an access token in the `Authorization` header of each request.

For example:
```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

To obtain an access token, you must authenticate with valid credentials using an authentication endpoint (not included in the above endpoints list). Refer to the API provider's documentation for information on how to obtain an access token.

## Error Handling

When using the Bank API, you may encounter errors under certain conditions. The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error responses to indicate the nature of the error. Common error codes include:

- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid or missing parameters.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Failed authentication or invalid access token.
- `404 Not Found`: Requested resource not found.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server-side error occurred.

Check the response status code and the accompanying error message for more details on the encountered error.
